1. There's a total of 576 players of that 84% are male, 14% are female and 2% are "Other / Non-Disclosed". The data shows of the 576 players 42% of them are between the ages of 20-24 and if we looked at the age group of 15-24 we would see that it makes up 68% of the total market. With that information, the marketing should be targeted towards those demographics.

2. The total revenue was $2379.77 of that males made up 83% spending a total of $1967.64 with this info I would suggest targeting the male audience between the ages of 15 and 24.

3. The "Final Critic" and the "Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm" were the two most popular and most profitable items so continuing to market those items would be in the companies best interest.
